# Naive Bayes Classification
### This is an implementation of Naive Bayes Classification in Python to implement a classification model whether an individual will buy a SUV.
#### Classification Variable - Buy an SUV?
#### Independent Variables - Age and Salary (assumption of Naive Bayes classifier as independent)

## Libraries used:
### Scikit-Learn - Implementation of classification model
### sklearn.metrics - confusion_matrix (to evaluate accuracy of classification)
### matplotlib - ListedColormap to visualize the regression model

### sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB = Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier
### 

## End Result:
### Classified whether an individual will buy a SUV or not based on their Age and Salary
