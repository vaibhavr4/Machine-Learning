#### Clustering variable - Spending score
#### Dependent Variables - Age and Annual income

## Libraries used:
### import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sch - Construction of dendograms
### from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering - Implement clustering model
### matplotlib - to visualize the cluster model

## End Result:
### CLustered various customers based on their spending scores and visualised the results to target selective customers.
