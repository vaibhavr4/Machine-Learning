# Polynomial Linear Regression
### This is an implementation of Polynomial Linear Regression in Python to predict the Salary of an employee.
#### Dependent Variable - Salary of an employee
#### Independent Variables - Level and Position of employee

## Libraries used:
### Scikit-Learn - Implementation of Regression model
### sklearn.preprocessing - PolynomialFeatures (to fit polynomial features to dataset)
### matplotlib - Scatter plot to visualize the regression model

## End Result:
### Predicted the salary of an employee with 6.5 years of experience or level 6.5
