# Data preprocessing template
### This python code is used as a template for data pre processing for implementation of various machine learning models.

## Techniques implemented:
+ Reading data from CSV file using pandas library
+ Splitting the data into test and training set using Scikit's model_selection library
+ Encoding categorical data using Scikit's preprocessing library - LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder
+ Feature Scaling using Scikit learn's preprocessing library - StandardScalar to scale data for effective Machine learning models
